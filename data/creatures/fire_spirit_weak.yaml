      - The fire spirit can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. A creature that touches the spirit or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. In addition, the spirit can enter a hostile creature's space on a turn; that creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage and catches fire. Until someone takes an action to douse the fire, the creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
