  horrifying_visage:
    text:
      - Each non-undead creature within 60 ft. that can see the banshee must succeed on a DC 13 Wis saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the banshee is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the banshee's Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours.
  wail:
    recharge: 1/Day
    text:
      - The banshee releases a mournful wail, provided that she isn't in sunlight. This wail has no effect on constructs and undead. All other creatures within 30 ft. of her that can hear her must make a DC 13 Con save. On a failure, a creature drops to 0 hit points. On a success, a creature takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage.
