name: Quaal's Feather Token
type: wondrous item
rarity: rare
text:
  - This tiny object looks like a feather. If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action. The feather token can be used in this way only once.
