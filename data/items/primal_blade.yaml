text:
  - The pommel of this magical shortsword is carved in the shaping of a roaring, wild jungle cat.
  - Once on your turn, when you take the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.
  - You channel primal energy to cause your teeth or fingernails to sharpen, ready to deliver a corrosive attack. They become natural weapons which you can use to make an unarmed strike. You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 acid damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
