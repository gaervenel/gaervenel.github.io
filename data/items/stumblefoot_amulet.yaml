  - This circular medallion is made of tarnished metal, and is emblazoned with a setting sun behind a majestic ship. On first glance, it does not appear to have more than sentimental value. A <span class="spell">detect magic</span> spell does not reveal that the amulet is magical. But during Cyr Stumblefoot's initiation on the wall and subsequent adventures, the amulet revealed some of its secrets.
  - The amulet has 3 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
