  h3 Tension Pool
  p
    | The tension pool is a pool of up to 6d6, which is used both for tracking time and generating consequences and complications. The tension pool allows the following actions:
  p
    span.subhead> Add a Die.
    | Add a d6 to the pool. If the pool reaches 6d6, immediately
    span.emph< roll the pool
    |, then
    span.emph< clear the pool
    |.
  p
    span.subhead> Roll the Pool.
    | Roll all the dice in the pool, then return them to the pool. If the pool is empty, roll 1d6, but do not add it to the pool. If any of the dice shows a 1, a
    span.emph<> complication
    | arises.
  p
    span.subhead> Roll a Full Pool.
    | Roll 6d6, but do not change the state of the pool. If any of the dice shows a 1, a
    span.emph<> complication
    | arises.
  p
    span.subhead> Clear the Pool.
    | Remove all dice from the pool.

  h4 Tracking Time
  p
    | The tension pool can be used to track time on an arbitrary scale. Select a unit of time &mdash; 10 minutes or 4 hours work well for dungeon exploration and wilderness exploration, respectively. Whenever one unit of time passes,
    span.emph<> add a die
    | to the pool. If the party does something reckless,
    span.emph<> roll the pool
    | to check for complications. You may do both actions, when the party does something reckless that also takes a unit of time.
  p
    | If the party passes a larger chunk of time (in a short rest, for example), you may choose to
    span.emph<> roll a full pool
    | to check for complications without clearing the pool, so that tension remains at the same level as before.
  P
    | Never clear the pool except as a result of adding a die.


  h3 Movement
  p
    | One travel period is
    span.emph< 4 hours
    |. A party can normally travel 3 periods in a day, after which they need to rest overnight or risk exhaustion.

  h5 Difficult Terrain
  p
    | Dense forests, deep swamps, steep mountains, ice-covered ground, or other difficult terrain halves distance traveled. In tactical movement, it costs an extra 1 ft. of movement per 1 foot traveled in difficult terrain.
  h5 Forced March
  p
    | The party can continue traveling after 3 consecutive periods, but they must make a DC 10 Con save or suffer a level of exhaustion. Each additional period increases the save DC by 5.

  h5 Climbing, Swimming, Crawling
  p
    | Climbing or Swimming takes twice as much movement as walking unless a creature has a climb or swim speed.
  p
    | Crawling costs an extra 1 ft. of movement per foot traveled.
  h5 Jumping
  p
    span.emph> High jump
    | 3 + Str mod ft.;
    span.emph<> long jump
    | Str score ft.; half distance without 10 ft. running start.
  p
    | May require DC 10 Dex save to land in difficult terrain without falling prone.
  h5 Standing
  p
    | Costs &#xbd; speed to stand up from prone.
  h5 Squeezing
  p
    | Squeezing through a small space costs double movement, you have disadvantage on Dex saves, and attack rolls against you have advantage.

  h3 Exhaustion
  p Exhaustion is measured in six levels. The effects are cumulative. Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.

  h3 Food &amp; Water
  h5 Food
  p
    | A character who goes for 3 + Con modifier days without eating 1 lb. of food suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of each day beyond that limit. A normal day of eating resets this counter.
  h5 Water
  p
    | A character needs 1 gallon of water per day, or 2 gallons in hot weather. A character who doesn't get enough to drink suffers a level of exhaustion at the ed of the day, or two levels of exhaustion if they are already exhausted. A character who drinks half the required amount can avoid this by succeeding on a DC 15 Con save.

  h3 Environment
  h5 Suffocation
  p
    | A creature can hold its breath for 1 + Con modifier minutes (min. 30s). After that, a creature can survive without breathing for Con modifier rounds (min. 1). At the end of its next turn after that, it drops to 0 hp.
  h5 Extreme Cold
  p
    | Below 0&#176;F, a creature must make a DC 10 Con save each hour or suffer 1 level of exhaustion. Creatures with cold resistance or immunity automatically succeed, as do creatures in cold weather gear or those naturally adapted to cold climates.
  h5 Frigid Water
  p
    | After Con score minutes immersed in frigid water, a character must succeed on a DC 10 Con save every additional minute or gain 1 level of exhaustion. Creatures with cold resistance or immunity automatically succeed, as do those naturally adapted to cold water.
  h5 Extreme Heat
  p
    | Above 100&#176;F, a creature without drinkable water must make a Con save each hour or suffer 1 level of exhaustion. The DC starts at 5 and increases by 1 each hour. Creatures in medium or heavy armor or heavy clothing have disadvantage on the save. Creatures with fire resistance or immunity automatically succeed, as do those naturally adapted to hot climates.
  h5 Strong Wind
  p
    | Imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon attacks and Wisdom (Perception) checks using hearing. Extinguishes open flames and disperses fog. A flying creature in a strong wind must land or fall at the end of its turn. Dust or sand in a strong wind also lightly obscures the area.
  h5 Heavy Precipitation
  p
    | Lightly obscures the area. Imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks using hearing. Extinguishes open flames.
  h5 High Altitude
  p
    | Traveling at altitudes above 10,000 ft. halves the distance a character can travel without exhaustion. Spending 30 days at this altitude acclimates a character and removes this penalty, but only up to 20,000 ft.
  h5 Slippery Ice
  p
    | Slippery ice is difficult terrain. When a creature moves onto slippery ice for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone.
  h5 Thin Ice
  p
    | A 10-ft. area breaks after 3d10 &times; 10 lbs.
  h5 Desecrated Ground
  p
    | Undead on desecrated ground have advantage on all saving throws. A vial of holy water can purify a 10-ft. area, and the
    span.spell<> hallow
    | spell purifies desecrated ground.
  h5 Razorvine
  p
    | A 10&times;10&times;5 ft. area of razorvine has AC 11, 25 hp, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and psychic damage. When a creature comes into contact with razorvine for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a DC 10 Dex save or take 5 (1d10) slashing damage.

  h3 Concealment
  p
    | Creatures in a
    span.emph<> lightly obscured
    | area have
    span.emph<> disadvantage
    | on Wisdom (Perception) checks using sight. Examples: dim light, patchy fog, moderate foliage.
  p
    | Any area that is
    span.emph<> heavily obscured
    | blocks vision. Creatures in a heavily obscured area are
    span.emph< blinded
    |. Examples: darkness, opaque fog, dense foliage.

  h3 Cover
  p
    | A creature with
    span.emph<> half cover
    | has a +2 bonus to AC and Dex saves. Examples: low wall, furniture, another creature, narrow tree trunk.
  p
    | A creature with
    span.emph<> three-quarters cover
    | has a +5 bonus to AC and Dex saves. Examples: portcullis, arrow slit, thick tree trunk.
  p
    | A creature with
    span.emph<> full cover
    | can't be directly targeted by spells or attacks.

  h3 Actions in Combat
  h5 Attack
  p
    | Make one melee or ranged attack.
  h5 Cast a Spell
  p
    | Not necessarily an action; use spell casting time. See spellcasting rules.
  h5 Dash
  p
    | Gain extra movement on this turn equal to your speed, after applying any modifiers.
  h5 Disengage
  p
    | Your movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity until the end of your turn.
  h5 Dodge
  p
    | Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saves with advantage. You lose this benefit if incapacitated, or if your speed drops to 0.
  h5 Help
  p
    | Aid a creature in a task; the creature gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task, if it happens before the end of your next turn.
  p
    | Alternatively, aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll has advantage.
  h5 Hide
  p
    | Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in attempt to hide.
  h5 Ready
  p
    | Declare a perceivable circumstance that will trigger your reaction, and an action you will take in response to it (alternatively, you may move up to your speed). When the trigger occurs, you can use your reaction to perform the action, or ignore the trigger.
  p
    | If you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold the energy. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of one action, and readying it requires
    span.emph< concentration
    |. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without effect.
  h5 Search
  p
    | Devote your attention to finding something. DM might have you roll Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation).
  h5 Use an Object
  p
    | When an object requires your action for its use, or you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.
  h3 Free Activity
  p
    | You may interact with one object on your turn, or communicate briefly, without using an action or your movement.
