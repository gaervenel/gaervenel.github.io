On first glance, it does not appear to have more than sentimental value. A <span class="spell">detect magic</span> spell does not reveal that the amulet is magical. But during Cyr Stumblefoot's initiation on the wall and subsequent adventures, the amulet revealed some of its secrets.</p><p>The amulet has 3 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.</p><p><span class="subhead">Luff Up.</span> The amulet fills you with confidence as you leap into the air, and you feel the wind supporting you.

When it has absorbed a total of 15 points of damage, the rod becomes useless and loses its magic.</p><p>As an action, you can use the rod to attempt extinguish a magical or non-magical fire that fits within a 5-ft. cube.

Conflict arises if the wearer shies away from combat or shows mercy to fallen opponents.</p><p>The headdress longs be worn by an orc worthy of leading the combined orc tribes of Nuvenel.

The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.</p><p>Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects.

When you reach ito the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.</p><p>The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.</p><p>Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a <span class="magic">bag of holding</span>, <span class="magic">portable hole</span>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane.

Vorastrixiv was the leader of a conclave of sorcerers during the height or Orthonax's reign. She used powerful magic to transfer her consciousness into other dragonborn's bodies, thereby attaining a kind of immortality. After a few centuries, her apprentice Nebani, who was to perform the ritual that would allow the transfer, instead betrayed her mistress and directed her soul into this gem instead.</p><p>A spellcaster who attunes to Vorastrixiv immediately takes 4d10 psychic damage. Attuning to Vorastrixiv grants no immediate benefits other than being able to communicate with her. In order to unlock more of Vorastrixiv's power, you must embed the jewel in your flesh. By holding it against your chest and asking Vorastrixiv to share her power, she can cause it to fuse into your chest, becoming one with your body. Once you have done so, the jewel cannot be removed except by killing the host creature, and you cannot voluntarily end your attunement with Vorastrixiv. Vorastrixiv, however, can end your attunement at any time if she so chooses.</p><p><span class="subhead">Conduit of Chaos.</span> While you have the jewel embedded in your flesh and are attuned to Vorastrixiv, you gain the ability to perceive and manipulate the wild forces of chaos underlying the order of creation.

On a roll of 1&ndash;5, you can't cast it again until the next dawn.</p><p><span class="subhead">Lightning Resistance.</span> While you have the jewel embedded in your flesh and are attuned to Vorastrixiv, you gain resistance to lightning damage.</p><p><span class="subhead">Second Self.</span> While you have the jewel embedded in your flesh and are attuned to Vorastrixiv, you can't be charmed or frightened (except by Vorastrixiv).</p><p><span class="subhead">Timeless Presence.</span> While you have the jewel embedded in your flesh and you are attuned to Vorastrixiv, your charisma score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24.</p><p><span class="subhead">Willing Vessel.</span> Vorastrixiv may try to trick an attuned creature into embedding the jewel, but she cannot force them to do so. However, once embedded, Vorastixiv gains more influence. While you have Vorastrixiv embedded in your flesh, you have disadvantage on Charisma saving throws to prevent her from taking control of you.</p><p><span class="subhead">Sentience.</span> Vorastrixiv is a sentient jewel of lawful evil alignment, with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 20.

She is also haughty and refined, having lived an aristocratic life during the height of the old Zhusan empire.</p><p>Vorastrixiv's purpose is to rebuild the conclave and gain revenge on her betrayer. She assumes that Nebani has persisted through the centuries using her own technique for transferring her consciousness. She believes that if she can regain control of the conclave, she will be able to shatter her prison and be reborn in a new vessel. She is confident that if she can convince the conclave of Nebani's treachery, they will side with her in seeking redress for the betrayal.</p></div><div class="magic-item group"><div class="heading"><h5>Mallorn Harp</h5><div class="magic">Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by someone proficient in playing the harp)</div></div><p>This small harp, carved from golden wood freely given by a mallorn tree, is an exquisite instrument, superior to an ordinary harp in every way.
