Once upon a time, it was a beautiful place that reflected the sky. Today, the waters have been somehow corrupted, and they now look to be covered in an oily film. The water is acidic; anyone who drinks a mouthful takes 1d6 acid damage. Merely touching the water is not harmful, but being immersed in it cases 1d10 acid damge per round.</p><h3>H1. Ridge</h3><p>To get to the rocky spire containing the warchief's tomb, the party must cross over the ridge in between the lake. The ridge is about 500 ft. long and a mere 10 ft. wide at the widest points. The entire ridge is difficult terrain. When the party is in the middle of it, the waters churn, and they are attacked by two <span class="emph">corrupted water spirits</span>, which have been infused with chaos and seek destruction.</p><h3>H2. Tomb Entrance</h3><p>On the other side of heaven's mirror, a natural spire of rock rises 60 ft. towards the sky, which feels very near to this place. A large boulder blocks a cave entrance. It takes a DC 20 Strength check to move the boulder. If the party fails, they can still move it, but they must find some source of leverage to do so.</p><h3>H3. Entry Passage</h3><p>A circular passage of worked, smooth stone, 10 ft. square, follows the countours of the spire up a short way. Along the passage, characters may notice sections of the floor spanning the width of the passage that appear to be designed to fall away or open into a pit with a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, but there is no obvious mechanism for triggering them, and so they cannot be disarmed. If triggered (see area H4), these panels fall away, leaving two 40-ft. long sections of the passage as gaping, open pits with no visible bottom. If the characters cannot find a way to cross them (the walls are smooth stone, and would be very difficult to climb), they may choose to descend into the mountain below.</p><h3>H4. Burial Chamber</h3><p>The winding passage leads to a circular burial chamber with no other exits. In the center of the chamber is a stone slab, on which is laid out a mummified orc corpse, wearing a black iron, spiky crown or headdress, wearing badly corroded plate armor, and holding a similiarly corroded greataxe on its chest. This is the great warchief Dhaggakk, who still wears the <span class="magic">headdress of the warchief</span>. Arranged around him on the slab are several treasured objects, each worth 25 gp: a carved bone statuette of an orc woman, a copper chalice, a small gold ring (perhaps an earring), a large silver belt buckle embossed with a battle scene of an orc and an elf, and a heavy, layered copper necklace.</p><p>Standing guard behind the mummified chief is an empty suit of (non-corroded) plate armor with a battleaxe and shield. This is a <span class="emph">helmed horror</span>, which stands motionless until it, the warchief, or any of the warchief's treasures is touched. On those triggers, it immediately attacks. Once as a lair action, at initiative count 20, the helmed horror can shout a command word to cause a rumbling in the earth. Each creature standing on the ground must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, and the panels in the passage fall away.</p></body></html>
